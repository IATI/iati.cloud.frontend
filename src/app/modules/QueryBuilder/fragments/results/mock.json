          "The contacts for the KAP survey were collected from more than 8 organizations working with boys and girls all across Lebanon (Akkar, Baalbek- Hermel, Beirut, Beqaa, Mount Lebanon, Nabatyeh, North, South), with a focus on marginalized communities, including camps and informal settlements and highlighted misconceptions of sexual health, especially in regards to starting-age of sexual activity, its potential risks, and the preventive methods that ought to be taken., The KAP survey was filled by youth participants between 18 and 24 of age in both Lebanese and non-Lebanese populations; The groups consisted of diverse participants of different sexes, (192 filled surveys in total, 93 Males, 97 Females, 2 Trans), and religious sects. Then, a Literature Review and evaluation of previous work was performed on resources that were available, and scientifically based published researches that were executed with main focus on the tool, and Meetings have been conducted with more than of 8 selected organizations and NGOs, where the framework of the survey, in particular, in regard to gaps, needs, and perceptions where discussed. The KAP Survey data analysis confirmed: - The theory that the youth is not aware of the measures they would have to take before having experiences which could lead to having psychologically, health-related and physically traumatic experiences. - A prominent indicator that awareness about STIs and the risks that unprotected and protected sex harbour is not fully understood or informed to the youth. Also, the majority have only focused on HIV disregarding the other infections: especially that these other infections are more viral and readily transmitted through non-penetrative sexual experiences that these youths are apparently unaware of. - Ignorance about body rights and SGBV. - Communications struggles considering sexual reproductive health and rights among families, different generations, religion, society, politics, and different convictions. - Misconception of consent, labelling, bullying, harassment, tolerance, acceptance, and difference between Gender, Sex, Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, Sexual Behaviour, and Sexuality. - Becoming more aware and educated about contraception and sexual health will decrease the number of unsafe sex, unprotected experiences, and unplanned/unwanted pregnancies. - Almost all participants (97%) wanted to receive more information, the youth are eager to learn more in order to become more responsible to avoid contracting and transmitting infections. - The majority prefers to receive these information and trainings from NGOs, workshops, and organizations that hold the highest preference percentage (19%), followed by Universities (12%), and equal preference for Schools and Women/Men of Religion (8%). - Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, Body Rights, , Sex and Gender Based Violence, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Mental Health, Marital Life, LGTBIQA rights and awareness, Child Marriage, Clinical Management of Rape, Religion and Sex, Women Rights, Sexual Health Centre’s (decreasing order) were all proposed by the participants, and it strengthens our hypothesis that there's lack of knowledge concerning these topics. Hence, the toolkit material was developed , yet not limited to the above listed results of the mentioned KAP survey, and includes 10 Learning Objectives in Arabic titled as: - Ethics, Rights and Obligations - Toolkit Learning Model - Youth Development and Body rights - Sexuality - Communication - Sexually Transmitted Infections - Harassment - SRHR - CMR In addition to the development of a booklet on how to utilize the Arabic produced tool and how to plan and train on the 10 Learning Objectives all in Arabic. The toolkit Validating did occur with pedagogy experts between May and Jul 2018 and was conducted and approved by the consultant of the tool validation."

          "These sessions aim to ensure proper implementation of law 293 related to domestic and sexual violence, provide training on women survivor’s protection needs, and maintain proper referral pathways. They will equip ISF centers with CMR PEP kits (post-exposure procedures in the case of rape/sexual assault). This is important as there are no unified national procedures for CMR, and ABAAD wants to ensure that the first persons of contact for victims of SGBV in the judicial/legal/investigative sphere (i.e. the ISF) are well-versed in the appropriate procedures for victims of sexual violence and assault. Through joint efforts, the ISF and ABAAD are raising awareness about crimes of sexual violence. In July 2017, ABAAD conducted a ToT on CMR sensitization for ISF senior officers. ISF then issued Memo # 339/204 s.4 in September 25th, 2017 on crimes of trafficking in persons and sexual assaults against women in Lebanon. This memo was then designed as a flyer (http://www.abaadmena.org/documents/ebook.1523729521.pdf) and poster (http://www.abaadmena.org/documents/ebook.1516286942.pdf) and distributed in the ISF Police Stations and to the public via checkpoints (ISF officers flagged down cars and passers-by, handing out pamphlets highlighting the laws protecting women and the role of the ISF in enforcing these statutes. The pamphlets include information on the steps women should take if they are experiencing any form of violence or harassment) Six meetings were then held with the head of the Internal Security Forces as well as the ISF Head of the Training and Research Department, where a MOU was signed between ABAAD and the ISF. These meetings resulted in an agreement between the ISF and ABAAD to 1) launch a national media campaign in 2018 on the ISF Due Diligence, and 2) conduct capacity building workshops for ISF members on the official memo, namely covering issues related to sexual assaults, clinical management of rape, as well as trafficking against women. Based on that, in November and December 2017, a ToT was issued to five high-ranking officers from the ISF. Weekly training sessions will then be given to more than twenty ISF officers per session to build their capacities on CMR and topics related to human trafficking and sexual assault, monitoring/identifying indicators, and conducting investigations. All ToTs conducted were done so with the objective of expanding the pool of trainers and ensure sustainability and a consistent flow of trainers within the Lebanese Internal Security Forces.

          "Between March and June 2017, 75 ISF members and officers across all Lebanese governorates received training's on CMR sensitization through four (two-day) sessions, on the following dates: 1. 28 & 29 March 2017 2. 18 & 19 April 2017 3. 23 & 24 May 2017 4. 20 & 21 June 2017 The table below shows the increase in knowledge/month between February – June 2017, according to the pre/post test results: March: pre-test 34% - post-test 84% -- % of change 50% April: pre-test 26% - post- test 80% -- % of change 54% May: pre-test 29% - post-test 81% -- % of change 52% June: pre-test 27% - post- test 85% -- % of change 58% These sessions aim to ensure proper implementation of law 293 related to domestic and sexual violence, provide training on women survivor’s protection needs, and maintain proper referral pathways. They will equip ISF centers with CMR PEP kits (post-exposure procedures in the case of rape/sexual assault). This is important as there are no unified national procedures for CMR, and ABAAD wants to ensure that the first persons of contact for victims of SGBV in the judicial/legal/investigative sphere (i.e. the ISF) are well-versed in the appropriate procedures for victims of sexual violence and assault. Through joint efforts, the Internal Security Forces (ISF) and ABAAD are raising awareness on crimes of sexual violence. In July 2017, ABAAD conducted a ToT on CMR sensitization for ISF senior officers. ISF then issued Memo # 339/204 s.4 in September 25th, 2017 on “Standards of Interaction and Investigation in Human Trafficking and Sexual Assault Crimes, and standards of support to survivors of such crimes” (annex #25). This memo was then designed as a flyer and poster, translated into two languages (English & French) that the Non-Arabic speakers can understand it, and distributed in the ISF Police Stations and to the public via checkpoints (ISF officers flagged down cars and passers-by, handing out pamphlets highlighting the laws protecting women and the role of the ISF in enforcing these statutes. The pamphlets include information on the steps women should take if they are experiencing any form of violence or harassment). Six meetings were then held with the head of the Internal Security Forces as well as the ISF Head of the Training and Research Department, where an MOU was signed between ABAAD and the ISF (annex #25). These meetings resulted in an agreement between the ISF and ABAAD to 1) launch a national media campaign in 2018 on the ISF Due Diligence, and 2) conduct capacity building workshops for ISF members on the official memo, namely covering issues related to sexual assaults, clinical management of rape, as well as trafficking against women. Based on that, in November and December 2017, a ToT was issued to five high-ranking officers from the ISF where their graduation ceremony took part on October 2018, during a conference organized under the patronage of the Director-General, General Imad Othman , in the presence of Minister of State for Women Affairs Mr. Jean Agassbian, H.E. Ambassador of the Netherlands in Lebanon Mr. Jean Weltmanns, the Director General of the Ministry of Information Hassan Falah, representatives of relevant ministries, the leadership of the army, security institutions and civil defense, judges, as well as representatives of civil society organizations. During 2018, weekly two days training sessions were given to more than One Thousand Two Hundred (1200) ISF officers for an average of 22 officers per session, with 96 female ISF officers (8% of the total participants) and 1104 male officers (92% of the participants). And with the aim of building their capacities on CMR, we used simultaneous interactive and informative sessions making the participation more appealing. Such activities included movies, role playing, and exercises attempting at creating a holistic understanding of the problems discussed in the sessions and addressing the following topics: - Essential concepts of sexual assault - Acquiring skills to handling survivors of sexual assault - Psycho-social and ethical elements needed when approaching a survivor of sexual assault - Important considerations to acquire when handling survivors of sexual assault in the male, children, and elderly population - Defining the clinical management of cases of sexual violence - Introducing the basics of prophylactic methods via the sexual assault aids kit - Interagency standard operating procedures (SOPs) for SGBV prevention and response in Lebanon - Referral systems in Lebanon - Practicing the essentials And on the second day, using explanatory/informative documentary and presentation on the memo. With the aim of building their capacities on topics related to human trafficking and sexual assault, monitoring/identifying indicators, and conducting investigations (annex #25). All ToTs conducted were done so with the objective of expanding the pool of trainers and ensure sustainability and a consistent flow of trainers within the Lebanese Internal Security Forces. This also dually acts as an exit strategy for ABAAD, as the ISF begins taking on the responsibility and due diligence in training its officers. Nevertheless, this memo was lunched during an activity organized jointly by The General Directorate of the Internal Security Forces and Abaad on April 14, 2018; an activity was about a parade by an ISF cycling squad, the Harley Davidsons Ladies Club and Lebanon Bikers from Ain Mreiseh neighbourhood of Beirut through two awareness checkpoints at the National Museum and Chevrolet roundabout areas to finally reach the Memorial of the women victims of domestic violence in Baabda, presidential palace road. During their tour, the cyclists distributed leaflets among passers to familiarize the above memo. Towards the end of the activity, the head of the PR division at ISF, Colonel Joseph Musallam, said: “When the ISF set its priorities for the protection of freedoms and human rights, it took into consideration the crimes committed against women,” and stressed the need to rethink some of the outdated inherited customs that impede the realization of women’s rights. Abaad director, Ghida Anani, for her part, pointed out that the memo is a sharp translation of ISF commitment to the file of domestic violence and violence against women and girls.",

Such activities included movies, role playing, and exercises attempting at creating a holistic understanding of the problems discussed in the sessions and addressing the following topics: - Essential concepts of sexual assault - Acquiring skills to handling survivors of sexual assault - Psycho-social and ethical elements needed when approaching a survivor of sexual assault - Important considerations to acquire when handling survivors of sexual assault in the male, children, and elderly population - Defining the clinical management of cases of sexual violence - Introducing the basics of prophylactic methods via the sexual assault aids kit - Interagency standard operating procedures (SOPs) for SGBV prevention and response in Lebanon - Referral systems in Lebanon - Practicing the essentials And on the second day, using explanatory/informative documentary and presentation on the memo. With the aim of building their capacities on topics related to human trafficking and sexual assault, monitoring/identifying indicators, and conducting investigations (annex #25). All ToTs conducted were done so with the objective of expanding the pool of trainers and ensure sustainability and a consistent flow of trainers within the Lebanese Internal Security Forces. This also dually acts as an exit strategy for ABAAD, as the ISF begins taking on the responsibility and due diligence in training its officers. Nevertheless, this memo was lunched during an activity organized jointly by The General Directorate of the Internal Security Forces and Abaad on April 14, 2018; an activity was about a parade by an ISF cycling squad, the Harley Davidsons Ladies Club and Lebanon Bikers from Ain Mreiseh neighbourhood of Beirut through two awareness checkpoints at the National Museum and Chevrolet roundabout areas to finally reach the Memorial of the women victims of domestic violence in Baabda, presidential palace road. During their tour, the cyclists distributed leaflets among passers to familiarize the above memo. Towards the end of the activity, the head of the PR division at ISF, Colonel Joseph Musallam, said: “When the ISF set its priorities for the protection of freedoms and human rights, it took into consideration the crimes committed against women,” and stressed the need to rethink some of the outdated inherited customs that impede the realization of women’s rights. Abaad director, Ghida Anani, for her part, pointed out that the memo is a sharp translation of ISF commitment to the file of domestic violence and violence against women and girls.\"}]}",

          "Abaad has consulted with the NMHP/MOPH for the development of accreditation criteria/standards to establish this specialized service facility. These accreditation standards, will provide a framework and act as a reference for organizations willing to establish a mental health facility targeting women and girls with mental health challenges and who are GBV survivors. . In parallel, we initiated negotiations with MoSA in September to ensure their full engagement and buy-in throughout the activity. Moreover, The first draft of the accreditation standards for the residential mental health facility was developed based on literature review. This draft was further reviewed based on findings from field visits to 2 specialized emergency safe sheltering program of 2 different organizations, and the detailed review of the first draft between NMHP and Abaad technical persons. The accreditation standards hence developed is targeting persons with mental conditions (including women and adolescents) residing in a facility for mental health treatment. Women can be accompanied by children. The persons in the residential mental health facility are expected to actively participate in the development of their care and recovery plan that will include rehabilitation and social reintegration activities related to their mental condition, and appropriately tailored to their GBV survivor condition. The persons in the residential mental health facility are expected to actively participate in the development of their care and recovery plan that will include rehabilitation and social reintegration activities. Some persons will be transferred to other facilities after mental health stabilization. The average length of stay is expected to range from few weeks to several months. The proposed mental health standards contain Measures of Quality linked to one of the following seven elements of quality: Accessibility, Appropriateness, Continuity of care, Effectiveness, Efficiency, Safety, Continuous Improvement Of Performance. The Measures of Quality are also distributed among the following three levels: Basic: Addresses basic structures and processes linked to the foundational elements of safety and quality improvement in primary health care service delivery. Advanced: Builds on the foundational elements of quality and safety, emphasizes key elements of participant-centred care and consistency in the delivery of services through standardized processes. Excellence: Demonstrates a commitment to excellence and leading the primary health care field in terms of quality and safety. The land dedicated for the activity was purchased toward end of the contract…Call to tender was initiated for design and built and accordingly construction process proceeded."

          "SSF and ABAAD joined their resources to provide to each shelter residents a tailored service based on their background, needs and expectations at professional level. Consequently, to contribute to the achievement of this activity, Safadi recruited an SGBV social worker to coordinate with ABAAD’s Case Managers and started the process. This social worker conducted info sessions with the beneficiaries to inform them about the project and to recruit a group of trainees, she met the MWH case workers to discuss the beneficiaries’ potential, set action and exit plans with ABAAD case worker for each beneficiary, prepared pre-posttests with the trainers according to the type of training, and attended a training workshop to ensure efficiency and increase in knowledge of the beneficiaries. The coordination between Safadi and ABAAD ensures delivery of both: a comprehensive system and the tailoring of activities to women survivors of or at risk for SGBV. The two-fold nature of these activities ensures the best possible outcomes for the MWH beneficiaries. Safadi team has conducted a pilot activity for six women in the Bekaa MWH,: - Developing an orientation system linking women in the safe shelters to community resources and the labor market - Assessing training centers and NGOs offering vocational training in local communities - Conducting case studies of women and girls in MWH in coordination with ABAAD’s team, and drafting a personal life-plan for these women while centering the economic integration process - Drafting accelerated vocational training curricula adapted to women’s capacities and resources including personal development and managerial skills. - Providing sessions given by a certified trainer on the basics of beauty care for any women with an interest or already established cosmetic skills. The aim of this is to tailor the socioeconomic development activities to the needs and interests of women in the shelters, rather than provide generic trainings. - Linking women to other NGOs responding to the integration process - Ensuring joint follow-up between Safadi Foundation and ABAAD - Conducting placement and job training and providing certification and individual kits for certified women - Assessing the MWH’s beneficiaries in the North and South MWH to check: number, profile, interests and skills in addition to the homogeneity of the groups regarding their age category and the period of residency. Based on the found results, it has been agreed to implement this activity with previous women beneficiaries of the MWH, and the activities took place at the nearest Women and girls safe space WGSS (Mount Lebanon: Choueifat, North: Quobbe) - Implementing two one-month Vocational Trainings for two groups of targeting 35 women participants and 1 Three months vocational training targeting 21 women participants from both refugee and host communities. By the end of this training, women participants gained marketing and managerial skills; - Linking women to other NGOs responding to the integration process and providing a placement program for trained and graduated women - Ensuring joint follow-up between Safadi Foundation and ABAAD - Closing ceremony and certification and individual kits distribution for graduated women coinciding with the IWD, in close coordination and support of respective municipalities."

PALWHO’s knowledge of the sociocultural context of Palestinian women in Lebanon aimed to provide specifically tailored activities for these women. The aim of this extension beyond the MWH was to reach underserved women in Palestinian camps, and to address the issue of socioeconomic empowerment and life skill building for women with limited mobility outside the camps."

          "Alternatively and as stated in original project document, and in order to mitigate any delay, ABAAD raised the proposition to replicate the Men Center through MOSA existent SDC structures and the Ministry agreed on establishing Men Centers in three main areas in Lebanon: the South, the Northern ML and Baalbek and to contribute fully to provide the location and its operational expenses from MOSA side. The centers of the MOSA ensures very long term sustainability. Moreover, ABAAD is familiar with the MOSA structure and its hierarchical system and has been able to work within and around it, based on the signed MoU between ABAAD and MoSA. As such, no challenges are foreseen on that front and this buy-in from MOSA can ensure sustainability of the service beyond the project. Furthermore, replicating these structures under MOSA can come as complementarity step for the roll-out of the National GBV SOP being led by MOSA and can open the gate for wider replication across the country beyond the three centers solely. For this end, ABAAD organized bilateral meetings with MOSA and local authorities to concretize and establish the Men Center across Lebanon, as well as homogenize the aforementioned SOP, which led to sign an MOU with MOSA for the up-scaling of the Men Centers (annexed #18) in order to homogenize referral pathways to the Men Center, as well as the Red Cross and/or SDC for the provision of these services. The 3 areas were strategically chosen based on a service gap needs’ identification. More specifically, Baalback was chosen to complement ABAAD’s Case Management Unit in Labweh & MWH in Beqaa. South/Bisariyyeh also complement the Women & Girls Safe Space in Bint Jbeil and the MWH in Southern Mount Lebanon. MoSA contributed with the physical structure, and ABAAD refurbished and equipped the centers in both areas , recruited the staff, managed and train the personnel composed of Psych-Social Worker, Case Worker, Center Coordinator as a permanent Staff and contracted with Psychotherapist form both areas. Both centers, begin running in the first half of 2018. In addition to this, MoSA contributed to normalize the concept of service provision specifically tailored for men and men’s rights to receive psychosocial services based on their gender roles, and the potential violent impacts and forms witnessed by men based on societal expectations and manifestations. Hence, four (8) support groups (4 groups in each center), 12 sessions each group, were conducted in the center’s catchment area targeting 108 adult men (74 Lebanese and 34 Syrian) With the aim at providing emotional support. The objectives revolved around providing participants with an open space to express and talk about daily stressors, expression of anger in a healthy way, and reflect on experiences of migration and exile in order to help the participants in “re”-creating complete narrative frames relevant to their personal stories. The participants were given an open platform to share fears and concerns as well as identify stress factors resulting from life events such as death, relationships and sexuality. In addition, the sessions contributed in providing the participating men and male youth with techniques and tools related to stress management, understanding gender roles, and acquiring positive coping mechanisms to respond adequately to the plight of the situation they are living in. The support group sessions were held over a period of two months for each group, covering three hours per session. The approach used in the delivery of support group sessions is based on a participatory model through which the participants debrief their emotions resulting from stressful events in a safe and trustworthy environment as well as reflect on their own experiences and thoughts. This exchange of opinions and experiences allows addressing misconceptions around topics of concern by setting the ground for a peer to peer support network that would be sustainable after the time of intervention is due. Themes and topics addressed: Through the above explained approach, two main layers, including several themes, were addressed as per the below: - Structured Psychosocial Support (GBV Oriented) - Identification of fears and concerns - Identification of anger and stress symptoms - Managing stress and anger - Emotional Support (Dealing with fears and concerns) - Death and separation - Friendship and relationships - Sexuality/Emotions Additionally, men participants in the support group sessions were referred to benefit from individual psychological services and follow up. This is considered as a first step toward achieving the purpose of the existence of the center in the area, since men statistically are less likely to seek help and more likely to discontinue participation in programs of psychosocial support period. This phenomenon is a result of the negative social stigma for men and help seeking behavior as it contradicts patriarchal masculine gender role socialization. Furthermore, during the span of the project, six workshops on “ Anger And Stress Management” took place within 2018 (3 workshops in the South and Bekaa centers) trageting 76 beneficiary (40 Syrian men and 36 lebanese men). These sessions contributed as mentioned above in providing the participating men and male youth with techniques and tools related to stress management, understanding gender roles, and acquiring positive coping mechanisms to respond adequately to the plight of the situation they are living in. Moreover, three (3) Community / Sports Events based and aligned with the Men Center campaign objectives has been carried out, targeting 1,062 men (592 from Syrian nationality and 470 form the Lebanese nationality), in collaboration with the municipalities in the areas. These events constitutes of:Marathon: Ghazieh International Race on 25 Nov 2018 were 600 Men and teenagers: - male Run with the aim of stop violence, wearing T- shirts with the slogan of the Men Center Campaign (إحسبها صح!) and the following activities tooked place: - MC flyers Distribution - Bracelets Dissemination, with printing the men center helpline number - Booth - in the presence of Municipality mayor and SDCs directors , 2 football teams (Male and female- gender equivalents) a mini football game took place were we: - Spread the messages of engaging men and ending VAW during the encouragements, - Distribute brochures about Abaad and men centers services - Distribute cups for the two teams and medals for the players In the interim, the center in Beirut was up-scaled to accommodate more capacity of sessions with men. As a direct result of the Men Center refresher campaign in September 2017, promoting as well the center’s line, ABAAD witnessed an increased number of beneficiaries at the center, from both refugee and host communities. Hence, the center in Beirut now can accommodate sessions in parallel in addition to a large space for support group sessions and stress & anger management workshops. - During the project period, around 400 men received psychotherapy sessions (around 4 sessions per beneficiary per month) as follows: 83.05% individual therapy, 14.41% couple therapy(only in Beirut Center), 2.54% family therapy(only in Beirut Center).",
          "Since the start of the project, ABAAD assessed the possibility of replicating the Men Center services at the Lebanese Red Cross (LRC) structures in both Tripoli and Saida and beyond. After several meetings with LRC head and concerned team, ABAAD identified possible challenges to proceed with LRC due to their hierarchical structure that might pose delays related to the prolonged and timely procedures they require, and that would span beyond the timeframe of the project. Furthermore, LRC is in process of developing their own internal GBV SOP system, and were leaning more towards on completing that process before deciding on scope of engagement in the GBV response (whether with men or women).",

The objectives revolved around providing participants with an open space to express and talk about daily stressors, expression of anger in a healthy way, and reflect on experiences of migration and exile in order to help the participants in “re”-creating complete narrative frames relevant to their personal stories. The participants were given an open platform to share fears and concerns as well as identify stress factors resulting from life events such as death, relationships and sexuality. In addition, the sessions contributed in providing the participating men and male youth with techniques and tools related to stress management, understanding gender roles, and acquiring positive coping mechanisms to respond adequately to the plight of the situation they are living in. The support group sessions were held over a period of two months for each group, covering three hours per session. The approach used in the delivery of support group sessions is based on a participatory model through which the participants debrief their emotions resulting from stressful events in a safe and trustworthy environment as well as reflect on their own experiences and thoughts. This exchange of opinions and experiences allows addressing misconceptions around topics of concern by setting the ground for a peer to peer support network that would be sustainable after the time of intervention is due. Themes and topics addressed: Through the above explained approach, two main layers, including several themes, were addressed as per the below: - Structured Psychosocial Support (GBV Oriented) - Identification of fears and concerns - Identification of anger and stress symptoms - Managing stress and anger - Emotional Support (Dealing with fears and concerns) - Death and separation - Friendship and relationships - Sexuality/Emotions Additionally, men participants in the support group sessions were referred to benefit from individual psychological services and follow up. This is considered as a first step toward achieving the purpose of the existence of the center in the area, since men statistically are less likely to seek help and more likely to discontinue participation in programs of psychosocial support period. This phenomenon is a result of the negative social stigma for men and help seeking behavior as it contradicts patriarchal masculine gender role socialization. Furthermore, during the span of the project, six workshops on “ Anger And Stress Management” took place within 2018 (3 workshops in the South and Bekaa centers) trageting 76 beneficiary (40 Syrian men and 36 lebanese men). These sessions contributed as mentioned above in providing the participating men and male youth with techniques and tools related to stress management, understanding gender roles, and acquiring positive coping mechanisms to respond adequately to the plight of the situation they are living in. Moreover, three (3) Community / Sports Events based and aligned with the Men Center campaign objectives has been carried out, targeting 1,062 men (592 from Syrian nationality and 470 form the Lebanese nationality), in collaboration with the municipalities in the areas. These events constitutes of:Marathon: Ghazieh International Race on 25 Nov 2018 were 600 Men and teenagers: - male Run with the aim of stop violence, wearing T- shirts with the slogan of the Men Center Campaign (إحسبها صح!) and the following activities tooked place: - MC flyers Distribution - Bracelets Dissemination, with printing the men center helpline number - Booth - in the presence of Municipality mayor and SDCs directors , 2 football teams (Male and female- gender equivalents) a mini football game took place were we: - Spread the messages of engaging men and ending VAW during the encouragements, - Distribute brochures about Abaad and men centers services - Distribute cups for the two teams and medals for the players In the interim, the center in Beirut was up-scaled to accommodate more capacity of sessions with men. As a direct result of the Men Center refresher campaign in September 2017, promoting as well the center’s line, ABAAD witnessed an increased number of beneficiaries at the center, from both refugee and host communities. Hence, the center in Beirut now can accommodate sessions in parallel in addition to a large space for support group sessions and stress & anger management workshops. - During the project period, around 400 men received psychotherapy sessions (around 4 sessions per beneficiary per month) as follows: 83.05% individual therapy, 14.41% couple therapy(only in Beirut Center), 2.54% family therapy(only in Beirut Center).\"}]}",

          "In August 2017, ABAAD signed an MOU with CILAT in order to address this gap. In October 2017, CILAT initiated contact with the Director Arab Regional Investigative Journalists for the sake of conducting the regional training. AREEJ showed high interest in this partnership. CILAT set the criteria for selecting the journalists who were to take part in the training. These were as follows: - Work in the media and journalistic field; - Have education background in media, communication or a related field - Show interest in investigative journalism - Demonstrate commitment in conducting investigative pieces on women and human rights related issues - Show sensitivity and awareness towards issues related to human and women’s rights Despite planning to launch a call for participants and disseminate it, organize trainings and contacting institutions and reporters to work on this issue, CILAT did not follow through with the MOU or the planned deliverables for reasons related to their internal processes. Subsequently, in order to mitigate this challenge ABAAD extended the scope of the contract with Fe-male to cover this activity in May 2018 ( Fe-male MOU and schedule # 2 annexed # 14) Moreover, Fe-male shared an announcement on their multiple social media platforms as well as sharing it with their mailing list as a call for participants. Many showed their interest and they received many applications, of which only 25 were chosen based on pre-selected requirement criteria. The workshop took place outside the capital and it went on for three consecutive days from the 21st until the 23rd of September 2018. Five professional trainers in the field were contracted Dr. Walid Saqaf (a specialist in the technology of media and journalism and a university instructor, who came all the way from Sweden), DR. Khouloud Khatib, Mrs. Rouba El Helou, Mrs. Madonna Khafaja and Ms. Youmna Fawaz, to deliver the workshop. The workshop was very intensive and interactive. Participants were engaged in hands-on activities as well as being involved in discussions away from lectures and mandating. The majority of the participants wished that they had more time for such workshops “Three days were not enough for the investigative journalism workshop, especially that we tackling issues of GBV. We need to dig deeper in this topic” as they considered the material important for their personal and professional growths in the field of gender and gender equality “I think that the toolkit is very rich in content and I’m looking forward to a TOT”- “I have been a journalist since a long while now, but I have never thought of using a gender-sensitive language while handling GBV cases. This workshop triggered the thought of it”; They also valued the knowledge provided to them since it was their first time to learn gender-sensitive reporting or he actual techniques of investigating. At the end of the workshop, it was announced that there will be technical support for the top four investigative topics. Fe-male received suggestions of 20 topics and Fe-Male along with the team of trainers selected them to produce investigative reports, following up with journalists who won the grant given by Fe-Male on gender-sensitive reporting, and the production of material for Sharika wa Laken. Each of the four selected journalist was assigned a mentor to follow up on producing complete gender-sensitive reports with accurate data and credible sources. The mentors, were chosen based on their availability, Mrs. Rouba El Helou, journalist Youmna Fawaz and lawyer Dr. Khoulod Al Khatib. The journalists were given a one month period to carry the task, and with the guidance of the mentors and Fe-Male they were provided with needed resources to fulfil this task (linking them with stakeholders, networking...). The publishing was dependent on ensuring that each report took its share of views and shares on the social media, and The links for the four (4) produced reports can be found below: Myra Abdallah: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/02/19/الهوية-الجندرية-القاتلة-في-العراق/ Jana Dheiby: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/02/25/قصّة-بنات-أبو-رجال-أبشع-أنواع-العنف-ال/ Zeinab Mohsen: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/03/20/حياة-قيد-الإنتظار-قصّص-نساء-في-المحاكم/ Hala Al Turk: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/03/26/أنا-أيضًا-صحافيات-يشهدن-ضدّ-أصحاب-نفوذ/ The topics tackled in these reports were all in the GBV discourse, mainly on trafficking, LGBTQI, harassment in media, personal status laws and child marriage. One of the topics, produced by the journalist Jana El Dheiby and mentored by reporter and journalist Youmna Fawaz, had the most views and shares during this period, which lead to provoking the Internal Security Forces to act and further investigate the case. The Minister, Ms. Raya Al Hassan, personally vowed to handle the case and called for immediate action to see the whereabouts of the case and punish all the responsible parties, and within ten days, action was indeed taken: The girl is now in the care of an NGO and the father is in the custody of the Security Forces.",
          "As a part of ABAAD’s holistic mission, this project aims to not only provide media personnel with the right tools to cover gender-sensitive investigative reporting, but also provide the most appropriate and effective framework for this reporting. Namely, not only should journalists be given the right resources to adapt to difficult and emotionally stressful contexts, but should also be provided with the frameworks that present GBV and gendered issues in the most objective and contextualized manner.",

          "{\"type\":\"4\",\"narrative\":[{\"lang\":\"en\",\"narrative\":\"In August 2017, ABAAD signed an MOU with CILAT in order to address this gap. In October 2017, CILAT initiated contact with the Director Arab Regional Investigative Journalists for the sake of conducting the regional training. AREEJ showed high interest in this partnership. CILAT set the criteria for selecting the journalists who were to take part in the training. These were as follows: - Work in the media and journalistic field; - Have education background in media, communication or a related field - Show interest in investigative journalism - Demonstrate commitment in conducting investigative pieces on women and human rights related issues - Show sensitivity and awareness towards issues related to human and women’s rights Despite planning to launch a call for participants and disseminate it, organize trainings and contacting institutions and reporters to work on this issue, CILAT did not follow through with the MOU or the planned deliverables for reasons related to their internal processes. Subsequently, in order to mitigate this challenge ABAAD extended the scope of the contract with Fe-male to cover this activity in May 2018 ( Fe-male MOU and schedule # 2 annexed # 14) Moreover, Fe-male shared an announcement on their multiple social media platforms as well as sharing it with their mailing list as a call for participants. Many showed their interest and they received many applications, of which only 25 were chosen based on pre-selected requirement criteria. The workshop took place outside the capital and it went on for three consecutive days from the 21st until the 23rd of September 2018. Five professional trainers in the field were contracted Dr. Walid Saqaf (a specialist in the technology of media and journalism and a university instructor, who came all the way from Sweden), DR. Khouloud Khatib, Mrs. Rouba El Helou, Mrs. Madonna Khafaja and Ms. Youmna Fawaz, to deliver the workshop. The workshop was very intensive and interactive. Participants were engaged in hands-on activities as well as being involved in discussions away from lectures and mandating. The majority of the participants wished that they had more time for such workshops “Three days were not enough for the investigative journalism workshop, especially that we tackling issues of GBV. We need to dig deeper in this topic” as they considered the material important for their personal and professional growths in the field of gender and gender equality “I think that the toolkit is very rich in content and I’m looking forward to a TOT”- “I have been a journalist since a long while now, but I have never thought of using a gender-sensitive language while handling GBV cases. This workshop triggered the thought of it”; They also valued the knowledge provided to them since it was their first time to learn gender-sensitive reporting or he actual techniques of investigating. At the end of the workshop, it was announced that there will be technical support for the top four investigative topics. Fe-male received suggestions of 20 topics and Fe-Male along with the team of trainers selected them to produce investigative reports, following up with journalists who won the grant given by Fe-Male on gender-sensitive reporting, and the production of material for Sharika wa Laken. Each of the four selected journalist was assigned a mentor to follow up on producing complete gender-sensitive reports with accurate data and credible sources. The mentors, were chosen based on their availability, Mrs. Rouba El Helou, journalist Youmna Fawaz and lawyer Dr. Khoulod Al Khatib. The journalists were given a one month period to carry the task, and with the guidance of the mentors and Fe-Male they were provided with needed resources to fulfil this task (linking them with stakeholders, networking...). The publishing was dependent on ensuring that each report took its share of views and shares on the social media, and The links for the four (4) produced reports can be found below: Myra Abdallah: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/02/19/الهوية-الجندرية-القاتلة-في-العراق/ Jana Dheiby: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/02/25/قصّة-بنات-أبو-رجال-أبشع-أنواع-العنف-ال/ Zeinab Mohsen: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/03/20/حياة-قيد-الإنتظار-قصّص-نساء-في-المحاكم/ Hala Al Turk: https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2019/03/26/أنا-أيضًا-صحافيات-يشهدن-ضدّ-أصحاب-نفوذ/ The topics tackled in these reports were all in the GBV discourse, mainly on trafficking, LGBTQI, harassment in media, personal status laws and child marriage. One of the topics, produced by the journalist Jana El Dheiby and mentored by reporter and journalist Youmna Fawaz, had the most views and shares during this period, which lead to provoking the Internal Security Forces to act and further investigate the case. The Minister, Ms. Raya Al Hassan, personally vowed to handle the case and called for immediate action to see the whereabouts of the case and punish all the responsible parties, and within ten days, action was indeed taken: The girl is now in the care of an NGO and the father is in the custody of the Security Forces.\"}]}",

          "Our partner was able to give a pilot self-care session to journalists in the field of women’s rights and GBV-related issues. This session, conducted by the expert consultant, certified life coach and positive psychology expert, Mr. Milad Hadchiti, was driven based on the aforementioned prior needs assessment. Based on this assessment, sessions were based in Beirut on January 31, 2018, February 28, 2018, June 20, 2018 & July 18, 2018, and in Tripoli (Northern Lebanon) on March 17, 2018, and June 19, 2018 targeting 92 Lebanese participants with 19 Male (21% of the participants) and 73 females (79% of participants) . These sessions were based primarily on stress reduction, wellbeing and resilience, based on the needs gauged earlier and the content was mostly practical and intended for the relief and the well-being of the participants and not to increase a certain knowledge. Based on the participants’ recommendations (and request, a one-day self-care session is not enough for the journalists who daily face hardships and some of them are in direct contact with victims or survivors of GBV and people who suffer. It is recommended that each session could be conducted in a form of a retreat, where the journalists can actually separate themselves from their surrounding for a while and enjoy the stress- releasing techniques. A short video/documentary was created to document these sessions, including interviews with the participating journalists."

This toolkit aims at reaching out to all the journalists/ reporters and training them to better tackle the cases of violence against women and perceive it as part of human rights, and not just another sensual story, in addition to encouraging a deeper understanding of the cases and the best ways of addressing them. For this end, a peer review committee was formed that includes specialists in the GBV sector, academics, trainers and linguists, and the toolkit has been developed. This was steered by desk research on coverage trends of GBV and women survivors of violence, and with the aim of ending negative stereotypes and generalizations of GBV and GBV-survivors, redirecting media coverage to ensure the highest standards of conduct, as well as protecting survivors from defamation.

          "The need for a code of conduct to regulate the way journalists and reporters deliver the information and to set limits to how far they can go in smearing the survivors’ reputations and/or jeopardizing their lives, lead to the need of producing a toolkit that would build the knowledge and skills of these journalists on issues related to gender-based violence. This toolkit aims at reaching out to all the journalists/ reporters and training them to better tackle the cases of violence against women and perceive it as part of human rights, and not just another sensual story, in addition to encouraging a deeper understanding of the cases and the best ways of addressing them. For this end, a peer review committee was formed that includes specialists in the GBV sector, academics, trainers and linguists, and the toolkit has been developed. This was steered by desk research on coverage trends of GBV and women survivors of violence, and with the aim of ending negative stereotypes and generalizations of GBV and GBV-survivors, redirecting media coverage to ensure the highest standards of conduct, as well as protecting survivors from defamation. It's composed from seven main chapters: - Introduction - Women’s rights in the international laws - Gender based Violence against women and girls - Principles and associated ethics to cover cases of violence against Women and girls - Gender Sensitive Media- Coverage - How to interview survivors of violence - Terminology - Annexes and document",

          "ABAAD sub-contracted a local feminist NGO called Fe-Male for the completion of these activities. Fe-Male is a civil feminist collective organization working with women and girls to eliminate injustice through building young feminist movement, empowering agents of change, and campaigning together against discriminatory norms and policies. Based on its strategic objectives, Fe-Male strives to improve the representation of women in media, and to eliminate the predictable social images that are projected on women and girls. Therefore, Fe-male was selected for their experience in working at the grassroots level in the media domain, and then trained. afterwards, using this extensive training, Fe-Male hired two consultants to write and produce the CoC, covering women’s issues in media in Lebanon, a code that aims at challenging women’s objectification in ads; and in covering women’s issues, mainly women survivors of violence, during and post conflict situations . The need for this CoC is due to the gap in available media resources and means of protection specifically for women and children. Despite efforts to make media in Lebanon more protective, these groups remain vulnerable, particularly in the case of conflict and post-conflict contexts. The main goals of this code are as follows: - Develop practical recommendations for gender-sensitive media coverage, particularly on issues of violence against women in armed conflict and post-conflict settings - Encourage the application of CoC clauses and manifests its recommendations on a practical and ground-level, including practicing gender-sensitive media coverage that does not judge (vilify or glorify) experiences of women and children survivors of violence - Guarantee the protection of women and children survivors of violence from the harsh light of gender-insensitive media (e.g. the harsh and decontextualized depiction of women survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault) Five Focus Groups discussions were held in November 2017 , one out of which was held with GBV survivors and the remaining four were held with fifteen professionals each, including case managers, academics, researchers, decision makers, social and case workers, NGO media officers and coordinators, as well as journalists. The CoC has been finalized, translated, proofread by 3 experts, designed, printed and disseminated through actors in both GBV and media sectors/networks, and launched during the event that took place on the 29th of May 2018 at NDU university during a one-day conference entitled, “A Voice of Our Own: Retelling the Stories of Gender Based Violence,” that was organized by the Faculty of Law & Political Science at the aforementioned University. The event was compromised of a gender NGO fair. TV host, writer, life coach, and trainer Milad Hadchiti hosted the opening ceremony, in the presence of the first Secretary of the Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands, Ms Bina Saib where she said, “We need to step away from stereotypes and challenge ourselves to tell a nuanced and balanced story that engages the public.” and the presence of Chairperson Dr. Dany Ghsoub where he called for “the immediate implementation of the COC to deal with all kinds of exploitation and protect freedom from oppression”. Moreover, an interactive panel discussion entitled “A Voice of Our Own,” took place during the event, moderated by the news reporter, writer, producer, and TV host Jad Ghosn. The Panel included Ms. Ghida Anani (ABAAD founder & Director), Mr. Frank Elbers, Ms. Hala Bejjani, Ms. Nidal Ayoub, and Mr. Eugene Sensenig. The speakers all agreed that social responsibility requires us to construct GBV stories in a way that enables us to celebrate survivors. Following the event, NDU’s FLPS professors vowed to continue their commitment to create an open space for people to communicate on gender-related issues by carrying out research projects, white papers, and a variety of GBV-related events, focusing on social justice and conflict resolution as well as considering including the toolkit in their curriculum - https://www.facebook.com/NaseejProject/videos/204940453634490/",

          "{\"type\":\"1\",\"narrative\":[{\"lang\":\"en\",\"narrative\":\"ABAAD sub-contracted a local feminist NGO called Fe-Male for the completion of these activities. Fe-Male is a civil feminist collective organization working with women and girls to eliminate injustice through building young feminist movement, empowering agents of change, and campaigning together against discriminatory norms and policies. Based on its strategic objectives, Fe-Male strives to improve the representation of women in media, and to eliminate the predictable social images that are projected on women and girls. Therefore, Fe-male was selected for their experience in working at the grassroots level in the media domain, and then trained. afterwards, using this extensive training, Fe-Male hired two consultants to write and produce the CoC, covering women’s issues in media in Lebanon, a code that aims at challenging women’s objectification in ads; and in covering women’s issues, mainly women survivors of violence, during and post conflict situations . The need for this CoC is due to the gap in available media resources and means of protection specifically for women and children. Despite efforts to make media in Lebanon more protective, these groups remain vulnerable, particularly in the case of conflict and post-conflict contexts. The main goals of this code are as follows: - Develop practical recommendations for gender-sensitive media coverage, particularly on issues of violence against women in armed conflict and post-conflict settings - Encourage the application of CoC clauses and manifests its recommendations on a practical and ground-level, including practicing gender-sensitive media coverage that does not judge (vilify or glorify) experiences of women and children survivors of violence - Guarantee the protection of women and children survivors of violence from the harsh light of gender-insensitive media (e.g. the harsh and decontextualized depiction of women survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault) Five Focus Groups discussions were held in November 2017 , one out of which was held with GBV survivors and the remaining four were held with fifteen professionals each, including case managers, academics, researchers, decision makers, social and case workers, NGO media officers and coordinators, as well as journalists. The CoC has been finalized, translated, proofread by 3 experts, designed, printed and disseminated through actors in both GBV and media sectors/networks, and launched during the event that took place on the 29th of May 2018 at NDU university during a one-day conference entitled, “A Voice of Our Own: Retelling the Stories of Gender Based Violence,” that was organized by the Faculty of Law & Political Science at the aforementioned University.

Moreover, an interactive panel discussion entitled “A Voice of Our Own,” took place during the event, moderated by the news reporter, writer, producer, and TV host Jad Ghosn. The Panel included Ms. Ghida Anani (ABAAD founder & Director), Mr. Frank Elbers, Ms. Hala Bejjani, Ms. Nidal Ayoub, and Mr. Eugene Sensenig. The speakers all agreed that social responsibility requires us to construct GBV stories in a way that enables us to celebrate survivors. Following the event, NDU’s FLPS professors vowed to continue their commitment to create an open space for people to communicate on gender-related issues by carrying out research projects, white papers, and a variety of GBV-related events, focusing on social justice and conflict resolution as well as considering including the toolkit in their curriculum - https://www.facebook.com/NaseejProject/videos/204940453634490/\"}]}",

          "In order to complete this activity, the NMHP has invited the MHPSS Task Force organizations to a ToT from which 22 applicants were selected according to their educational background, years of experience and previous experience in conducting trainings after submitting a filled Google form and a signed letter of intent from their organization to conduct 5 self-care sessions for frontline workers. The 2 days ToT took place on the 15th and the 16th of October 2018 in the presence of an observer from ABAAD and facilitators from the NMHP (attendance sheet+ Agenda- Annex# 6). The master trainer from the NMHP presented the self-care manual at the first day of the ToT and explained to participants how to conduct the training, how to deliver the main key messages and how to use the self-care techniques in each domain. At the end of the first day, the master trainer assigned every person to a section of the manual in order to prepare it and present it the next day using one facilitation method as an example to what can be done in the actual self-care sessions. The entire second day was dedicated for the presentations of the assigned section of the manual, after every presentation the other participants as well as the master trainer and the observer from ABAAD gave constructive comments and feedback to improve the performance of participants when they start their own self-care sessions with front-liners. Evaluation sheets were distributed at the end of the first day to take the feedback of participants on the material and the master trainer. The compilation of the evaluation forms showed that 45% of participants thought the overall training was excellent and all of them answered yes when asked if they recommend the training to others. Training evaluation results: Figure 1: Training of trainers-Overall training rating Figure 2: Training of trainers-Training recommendation outcomes In terms of the training workshop the main points where participants strongly disagreed were: that the content is organized and easy to follow (14%), the training techniques and methods were useful and helpful (10%) and that the time allotted for the training was sufficient (10%). And more than 50% strongly agreed that the trainer was well prepared and knowledgeable about the training topics. Figure 3: Training of trainers-Training evaluation outcomes Refresher training A one day refresher training was scheduled as a follow up to the ToT and invitations were sent to all the participants who attended previously. The main goal of the refresher training was to further support participants in the implementation and roll out of the self-care sessions in a standardized and harmonized way. The refresher training session was held on the 14th of December 2018 with 15 participants out of the 22 (attendance sheet-Annex 7). During this session, the master trainer shed the light on important concepts and gave participants additional tips on how to conduct the sessions. The hand-outs and pre-post-tests that are supposed to be handed to frontliner’s attending the self-care sessions were distributed to participants to get their feedback before their finalization. After the refresher session all participants were urged to start planning the 5 self-care sessions to frontliners taking into consideration that the first session should be supervised by a team member of the technical unit of the NMHP or by the observer from ABAAD team. Rolling-out of self-care sessions: The trainers started the first supervised self-care session with frontliner’s from their own organizations, The supervisors (from ABAAD and NMHP) filled a trainer’s evaluation form and constructive comments were given to the trainer onsite for them to improve performance in the next 4 unsupervised sessions. A Total of 54 self-care sessions in the six governorates for front-liners were conducted by 15 trainers completed their first supervised sessions targeting 412 participants from which 32 are males and 380 are females. Certificates were distributed to trainers who completed the training and held self-care sessions to frontliner’s. Conclusion: The national self-care manual for front-liners is considered a guide for organizations who are interested in training their front-liners on self-care and providing them with practical tools and techniques to help them take care of themselves. Self-care component should be included in the policies of all organizations generally and in organizations working in the humanitarian field specifically. Those TOTs has created a group of trainers committed to training the largest number of front-liners possible in all of the sectors in Lebanon ensuring sustainability, however more TOTs are needed in order to create a wide pool of self-care trainers. Moreover, 28 info sessions about the manual were conducted, targeting around 560 of the GBV and CP front-liners In all regions, aiming at defining the guide, its objectives and the importance of its adoption and implementation.",

Evaluation sheets were distributed at the end of the first day to take the feedback of participants on the material and the master trainer. The compilation of the evaluation forms showed that 45% of participants thought the overall training was excellent and all of them answered yes when asked if they recommend the training to others. Training evaluation results: Figure 1: Training of trainers-Overall training rating Figure 2: Training of trainers-Training recommendation outcomes In terms of the training workshop the main points where participants strongly disagreed were: that the content is organized and easy to follow (14%), the training techniques and methods were useful and helpful (10%) and that the time allotted for the training was sufficient (10%). And more than 50% strongly agreed that the trainer was well prepared and knowledgeable about the training topics. Figure 3: Training of trainers-Training evaluation outcomes Refresher training A one day refresher training was scheduled as a follow up to the ToT and invitations were sent to all the participants who attended previously. The main goal of the refresher training was to further support participants in the implementation and roll out of the self-care sessions in a standardized and harmonized way. The refresher training session was held on the 14th of December 2018 with 15 participants out of the 22 (attendance sheet-Annex 7). During this session, the master trainer shed the light on important concepts and gave participants additional tips on how to conduct the sessions. The hand-outs and pre-post-tests that are supposed to be handed to frontliner’s attending the self-care sessions were distributed to participants to get their feedback before their finalization. After the refresher session all participants were urged to start planning the 5 self-care sessions to frontliners taking into consideration that the first session should be supervised by a team member of the technical unit of the NMHP or by the observer from ABAAD team. Rolling-out of self-care sessions: The trainers started the first supervised self-care session with frontliner’s from their own organizations, The supervisors (from ABAAD and NMHP) filled a trainer’s evaluation form and constructive comments were given to the trainer onsite for them to improve performance in the next 4 unsupervised sessions. A Total of 54 self-care sessions in the six governorates for front-liners were conducted by 15 trainers completed their first supervised sessions targeting 412 participants from which 32 are males and 380 are females. Certificates were distributed to trainers who completed the training and held self-care sessions to frontliner’s. Conclusion: The national self-care manual for front-liners is considered a guide for organizations who are interested in training their front-liners on self-care and providing them with practical tools and techniques to help them take care of themselves. Self-care component should be included in the policies of all organizations generally and in organizations working in the humanitarian field specifically. Those TOTs has created a group of trainers committed to training the largest number of front-liners possible in all of the sectors in Lebanon ensuring sustainability, however more TOTs are needed in order to create a wide pool of self-care trainers. Moreover, 28 info sessions about the manual were conducted, targeting around 560 of the GBV and CP front-liners In all regions, aiming at defining the guide, its objectives and the importance of its adoption and implementation.\"}]}",

          "In Lebanon, the Syrian crisis has been ongoing for more than 8 years, causing massive displacement and increase in demand on services, especially in terms of CP and GBV sectors. As a result, frontline staff members working in those sectors are trained on and asked to perform additional tasks regularly, which will oftentimes make them feel overloaded and burnt-out, especially when the organizations have limited resources to support their staff, and underdeveloped pre-employment preparation and stress management practices. With the goal to improve the wellbeing of CP and GBV service providers, ABAAD conducted a meeting with the Head of MoPH’s National MHPSS programme in August 2017 for the production of a national self-care curriculum for that purpose endorsed by the Ministry of Public Health. In December 2017, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between ABAAD and MoPH—the National Mental Health Program (NMHP), which defines the two institutions’ scope of work. This MOU sets the modalities to ensure that victims of SGBV receive comprehensive and equitable MH services. Moving forward, in December 2017, ABAAD signed a contract with National Mental Health Program (NMHP) to develop the self-care curriculum. As part of the strategic objective annexof the MHPSS TF related to capacity building of the staff upon their specific needs and in line with the strategic objective of the National Mental Health Strategy: objective 2.2.2 Develop a capacity building proposal tailored for non-specialized health and social welfare/protection care staff at all levels of care in collaboration with all relevant actors, the first national self-care manual for front liners working in the CP and GBV sectors was developed. This national self-help curriculum aims to build the capacities of overloaded service provider personnel and create more sustainable modalities of work, promoting rest, relaxation and wellbeing in times of increased stress and pressure. Self-care activities globally involve behavioral, experiential, psychodynamic, and systematic traditions, but the activities defined in this curriculum were based more specifically on the needs of front-liners working with vulnerable populations in Lebanon, and will be adapted to the local context. Development process Developing the self-care manual was preceded by a thorough literature review in addition to bilateral meetings with self-care experts and a needs assessment was conducted in order for the manual to be well adapted to the context of front liners and target their needs. A-Literature review The literature review was conducted before the needs assessment took place and extended until after the results of the needs assessment were analysed and all evidence based articles read and used in the manual were compiled and saved for references. B-Needs assessment The needs assessment was conducted through a qualitative methodology design consisting of 7 bilateral meetings that took place at the NMHP offices and ABAAD offices with self-care experts (MH practitioners and psychotherapists) working closely with frontlines from ABAAD to benefit from their experience in the field of self-care, in addition to 3 focus groups discussions (FGDs) with 44 frontlines from different NGO and MoSA social workers, randomly selected by their organizations through an invitation disseminated by the MHPSS task force and ABAAD in addition to an invitation sent to Social Development Centers (SDCs) disseminated by MOSA centrally. The goal of the needs assessment was to maximize the efficiency of the training and the adequacy of the manual and to adapt them taking in consideration the frontliner’s perception. The main objectives of the needs assessment were to collect from participants: - Their current knowledge about self-care - Their perceived challenges in the field - Their needs in terms of self-care - Their expectations anticipated from a self-care training Findings of the needs assessment: The questions addressed in both the focus group discussions and the bilateral meetings were similar and mainly revolving around: - The understanding of self-care - The challenges faced in the field - The self-care techniques used by individuals - The expectations from a self-care training - What do they expect from their organizations in terms of self-care After the finalization of the self-care draft manual, the document was shared with external reviewers, from UN agencies (WHO, UNRWA, UNICEF), international and national independent technical experts that led to the compilation of their comments and feedbacks and updating the document accordingly. The manual is composed of three main chapters as reflected below: - Introduction to Self- Care - Impact of psychosocial Adversity on field workers - The 4 domains of self-care: 1-Physiological 2-Professional 3-Psychological 4-Spiritual Nevertheless, the document was translated into the Arabic language and both versions (English and Arabic) were designed jointly in one document.",

          "Throughout ABAAD’s extensive work on the field and with women & girls survivors of GBV, the need for producing a national unified Gender Based Violence Standardized Operational Procedures (GBV SOPs) and related tools and documents arose. This much-needed tool could help not only GBV front-liners, but also members of the Internal Security Forces (ISF), Health workers, Social Workers, various ministries as well as research and advocacy NGOs in the field of GBV.",
          "In 2012, ABAAD established and has been co-chairing the National Technical Task Force to end GBV in Lebanon (NTTF) which is directly chaired by H.E the Minister of Social Affairs. This collaborative relationship with the ministry comes as an integral part of ABAAD’s core belief that the state has a fundamental role in eliminating GBV and supporting all related efforts. As such, NTTF’s main objective from the very start was to identify national priorities in the area of combating VAW (Violence Against Women), as well as to set and develop national action plans aimed at addressing GBV challenges, preventing its prevalence, and mitigating its impact. For this end, an expert lead consultant, Dr. Jean Kors, was subcontracted to develop this SOP following a thorough consultation in the field on best profile to lead this work and a number of set criteria, and most importantly with a consensus and buy-in from the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA), as the lead ministry to this national process, who contributed in the revision of the ToR and work plan and recruitment the process. The GBV SOP was developed through a collaborative consultative process that engaged government and non-governmental organizations, concerned UN agencies (UNICEF/UNFPA/UNHCR/UNW/WFP…), national GBV CSOs & safe shelters (Mary & Martha; YWCA, Sisters of Good Shepard…), Syndicates (of doctors, of midwives, of nurses, of social workers, of psychotherapists…) and relevant representatives of the communities and groups that are affected by, or that can influence, the prevalence and impact of GBV in Lebanon. Dr. Jean Kors completed the national GBV SOP through a participatory and dynamic methodology that ensured proper consultation with the main stakeholders. The process was completed under the sponsorship and support of the Lebanese Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), and in collaboration with the National Technical Task Force to end GBV in Lebanon (NTTF), as well as other relevant national stakeholders including the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoI), the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Ministry of Education & Higher Education (MEHE) and the GBV sector in Lebanon. The GBV SOP includes actions and commitments for duty bearers at all public and civil levels, all aimed at the mitigation of GBV prevalence and impact. This emphasizes the need to steer all stakeholders to strengthen not only their internal systems and services, but most importantly their accountability and commitment to collaboration, coordination and excellence. To ensure the best interests of the targeted groups, all interventions, starting from this process itself and to the creation and implementation of all procedures and policies, the following guiding principles were adopted and practiced: - Compliance with all applicable human research regulations and ethical conducts related to human research - Participation and involvement - Non-Discrimination - Social value - Do not Harm / Protection from physical, mental and emotional harm - Collaboration and information - Respect for persons - Best interests of GBV survivors - Survivor-centered approach - Access to information - Scientific validity - Accountability Moreover, the GBV SOP is composed of five (5) main sections: - Standard Operating Procedures - Standards and quality of work - Case Management - Referral System - Referral Pathways - In addition to 2 sections related to Recommendations and Forms. Several meetings took place between ABAAD and MoSA, resulting in correspondence with the main representatives to form a steering committee. The expert conducted a desk review of the material and conducted 29 semi-structured interviews with NGOs, INGOs, ministries & official entities, UN agencies, and national GBV experts, to gather specific qualitative information. He also analyzed the feedback/data that was collected through mixed methods from the research in order to come up with the SOP. The GBV SOP has been reviewed by the national GBV actors (Official entities and civil society organisations) during a consultation meeting held on July 19, 2018 with the presence of 57 participants representing GBV actors, in addition to MOSA and ABAAD staff members. The Document has been endorsed by MOSA and reviewed by the steering committee composed from the ministries of Justice, Interior (ISF), Public Health (MOPH), Social Affairs and ABAAD during the meeting that was held on November 29, 2018. In parallel to this, the consultant, with the support of NASEEJ’s team, conducted mapping for all available GBV service providers and all GBV-related actors and front-liners (ISF, judges, NGOs, INGOs, ministries, Forensic Doctors, lawyers, hospitals, health facilities, etc…) that can be used for the referral pathway to be developed in line with the centralized helpline that ABAAD is managing. The consultant also designed a survey as an instrument to examine the availability and/or lack of adequate services provided to GBV survivors both by service providers and relevant agencies that have been identified in the earlier mapping exercise. This survey has been sent to the identified actors providing services for GBV survivors who were asked to fill in the survey with proper data to the best of their knowledge. List of interviewees, NTTF and steering committee memo for this activity, attendance list of the consultation meeting, list of interviewees and the SOP document are attached in Annex # I. To note that this National GBV SOP is the broader umbrella of the GBV SOP in Emergency setting document that was developed by the GBV Task Force sector and printed with the support of the RDDP project and transformed, with support from Diakonia and RDDP into a mobile application for humanitarian responders to GBV in Lebanon entitled RESPOND!",

To ensure the best interests of the targeted groups, all interventions, starting from this process itself and to the creation and implementation of all procedures and policies, the following guiding principles were adopted and practiced:  Compliance with all applicable human research regulations and ethical conducts related to human research  Participation and involvement  Non-Discrimination  Social value  Do not Harm / Protection from physical, mental and emotional harm  Collaboration and information  Respect for persons  Best interests of GBV survivors  Survivor-centered approach  Access to information  Scientific validity  Accountability Several meetings took place between ABAAD and MoSA, resulting in correspondence with the main representatives form a steering committee. The expert conducted a desk review of the material and conducted 29 semi-structured interviews to gather specific qualitative information. He also analyzed the feedback/data that was collected through mixed methods from the qualitative research in order to come up with the SOP. The first draft of this SOP has now been finalized and sent to MOSA and the steering committee for review. In parallel to this, the consultant, with the support of NASEEJ’s team, conducted mapping for all available GBV service providers and all GBV-related actors and front-liners (ISF, judges, NGOs, INGOs, ministries, hospitals, health facilities, etc…) that can be used for the referral pathway to be developed in line with the centralized helpline that ABAAD is managing. The consultant has also designed a survey as an instrument to examine the availability and/or lack of adequate services provided to GBV survivors both by service providers and relevant agencies that have been identified in the earlier mapping exercise. This survey will be sent to the identified actors providing services for GBV survivors who will be asked to fill in the survey with proper data to the best of their knowledge. List of interviewees, and NTTF and steering committee memo for this activity & copy of the first completed draft of the SOP are attached in Annex # I. To note that this National GBV SOP is the broader umbrella of the GBV SOP in Emergency setting document that was developed by the GBV Task Force sector and printed with the support of the RDDP project and transformed, with support from Diakonia and RDDP into a mobile application for humanitarian responders to GBV in Lebanon entitled RESPOND!"

          "{\"type\":\"1\",\"narrative\":[{\"lang\":\"en\",\"narrative\":\"In 2012, ABAAD established and has been co-chairing the National Technical Task Force to end GBV in Lebanon (NTTF) which is directly chaired by H.E the Minister of Social Affairs. This collaborative relationship with the ministry comes as an integral part of ABAAD’s core belief that the state has a fundamental role in eliminating GBV and supporting all related efforts. As such, NTTF’s main objective from the very start was to identify national priorities in the area of combating VAW (Violence Against Women), as well as to set and develop national action plans aimed at addressing GBV challenges, preventing its prevalence, and mitigating its impact. For this end, an expert lead consultant, Dr. Jean Kors, was subcontracted to develop this SOP following a thorough consultation in the field on best profile to lead this work and a number of set criteria, and most importantly with a consensus and buy-in from the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA), as the lead ministry to this national process, who contributed in the revision of the ToR and work plan and recruitment the process. The GBV SOP was developed through a collaborative consultative process that engaged government and non-governmental organizations, concerned UN agencies (UNICEF/UNFPA/UNHCR/UNW/WFP…), national GBV CSOs & safe shelters (Mary & Martha; YWCA, Sisters of Good Shepard…), Syndicates (of doctors, of midwives, of nurses, of social workers, of psychotherapists…) and relevant representatives of the communities and groups that are affected by, or that can influence, the prevalence and impact of GBV in Lebanon. Dr. Jean Kors completed the national GBV SOP through a participatory and dynamic methodology that ensured proper consultation with the main stakeholders. The process was completed under the sponsorship and support of the Lebanese Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), and in collaboration with the National Technical Task Force to end GBV in Lebanon (NTTF), as well as other relevant national stakeholders including the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoI), the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Ministry of Education & Higher Education (MEHE) and the GBV sector in Lebanon. The GBV SOP includes actions and commitments for duty bearers at all public and civil levels, all aimed at the mitigation of GBV prevalence and impact. This emphasizes the need to steer all stakeholders to strengthen not only their internal systems and services, but most importantly their accountability and commitment to collaboration, coordination and excellence. To ensure the best interests of the targeted groups, all interventions, starting from this process itself and to the creation and implementation of all procedures and policies, the following guiding principles were adopted and practiced: - Compliance with all applicable human research regulations and ethical conducts related to human research - Participation and involvement - Non-Discrimination - Social value - Do not Harm / Protection from physical, mental and emotional harm - Collaboration and information - Respect for persons - Best interests of GBV survivors - Survivor-centered approach - Access to information - Scientific validity - Accountability Moreover, the GBV SOP is composed of five (5) main sections: - Standard Operating Procedures - Standards and quality of work - Case Management - Referral System - Referral Pathways - In addition to 2 sections related to Recommendations and Forms. Several meetings took place between ABAAD and MoSA, resulting in correspondence with the main representatives to form a steering committee. The expert conducted a desk review of the material and conducted 29 semi-structured interviews with NGOs, INGOs, ministries & official entities, UN agencies, and national GBV experts, to gather specific qualitative information. He also analyzed the feedback/data that was collected through mixed methods from the research in order to come up with the SOP. The GBV SOP has been reviewed by the national GBV actors (Official entities and civil society organisations) during a consultation meeting held on July 19, 2018 with the presence of 57 participants representing GBV actors, in addition to MOSA and ABAAD staff members. The Document has been endorsed by MOSA and reviewed by the steering committee composed from the ministries of Justice, Interior (ISF), Public Health (MOPH), Social Affairs and ABAAD during the meeting that was held on November 29, 2018. In parallel to this, the consultant, with the support of NASEEJ’s team, conducted mapping for all available GBV service providers and all GBV-related actors and front-liners (ISF, judges, NGOs, INGOs, ministries, Forensic Doctors, lawyers, hospitals, health facilities, etc…) that can be used for the referral pathway to be developed in line with the centralized helpline that ABAAD is managing.
